# Telecom Customer Churn

## Introduction

The selected data source is the open-source Cell2Cell dataset provided by the Teradata Center for Customer Relationship Management at Duke University.

This preprocessed Cell2Cell dataset has been balanced for process analysis, comprising 71,047 instances and 58 attributes. We can employ both traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms to assess metrics such as accuracy, ROC, and AUC.

In the telecom industry, intense competition exists in satisfying customers. The churn prediction system's role extends beyond accurately predicting churners to understanding customer churn behavior.

Churn management in the telecom sector aims to retain customers for a company. Effective customer management involves anticipating when a customer may switch to another service provider, assessing customer profitability, and implementing a range of strategic and tactical retention strategies to minimize customer attrition.

In practical terms, we can categorize customers by profitability and concentrate retention efforts on the profitable segments. Additionally, we can assign a churn propensity score to the entire customer base, enabling us to prioritize retention initiatives based on both profitability and churn likelihood.

## Conclusion

Through this project, we have successfully addressed the critical concerns of customer acquisition and retention, particularly in the highly competitive and rapidly evolving telecommunications industry. By allocating valuable resources to the Retention Campaign, we have demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of retaining existing customers compared to acquiring new ones.

Recognizing the diverse factors contributing to customer churn, we have emphasized the importance of proactive churn management. This approach is vital for not only expanding the customer base but also maximizing profitability.

The primary objective of our churn analysis has been to identify contracts with a high likelihood of cancellation in the near future. Through targeted efforts and special incentives, we have successfully mitigated potential cancellations.

Moreover, our project has advanced to a more refined level, focusing on understanding the underlying reasons behind anticipated cancellations. This invaluable information enables us to tailor offers and services to meet the unique needs and preferences of our customers.
